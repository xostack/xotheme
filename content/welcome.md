# Welcome to XOtheme

This is a sample blog post to demonstrate the XOtheme's post layout and typography. The theme is designed with accessibility and performance as top priorities.

## Key Features

- **Semantic HTML** that works without CSS
- **Typography-focused** design with carefully selected fonts  
- **Zero JavaScript** by default
- **WCAG AA compliant** accessibility

The theme uses three font families optimized for different purposes:
- Atkinson Hyperlegible for body text
- Merriweather for headings
- Victor Mono for code

## Code Example

Here's a sample code block:

```html
<article class="post">
  <header class="post-header">
    <h1>Post Title</h1>
    <time datetime="2025-07-20">July 20, 2025</time>
  </header>
  <div class="post-content">
    <!-- Content here -->
  </div>
</article>
```

This demonstrates how the theme maintains semantic structure while providing beautiful typography.
