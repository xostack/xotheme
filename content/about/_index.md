# About

This is a sample about page to demonstrate the XOtheme's page layout and typography system.

## The Theme

XOtheme is a minimal, accessible Zola theme designed for developers and writers who want a clean, fast-loading site without sacrificing accessibility or design quality.

### Key Features

- **Semantic HTML5** markup that works without CSS
- **WCAG AA compliant** accessibility features
- **Zero JavaScript** by default - everything works with CSS only
- **Typography-focused** design with carefully selected fonts
- **Dark/light themes** that respect user preferences

## Typography

The theme uses three carefully selected font families:

1. **Atkinson Hyperlegible** (Primary) - Designed by the Braille Institute for enhanced legibility
2. **Merriweather** (Serif) - A reading font optimized for screens
3. **Victor Mono** (Monospace) - A programming font with excellent clarity

All fonts are self-hosted for privacy and performance.
